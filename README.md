# Coding Challenge 129: Koch Fractal Snowflake

My variation of the Koch Fractal Snowflake from [Coding Train's](https://github.com/CodingTrain) [Coding Challenge 129](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8bXDKqMsXE). I added the ability to interpolate the curve between integer recursion depths, and sliders to control a smooth oscillation between recursion depths.
